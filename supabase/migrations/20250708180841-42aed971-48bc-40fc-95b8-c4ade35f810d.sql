-- Note: Both generate-voice and generate-video edge functions now use identical gentle teacher voice settings:
-- stability: 0.85 (higher for more consistent delivery)
-- similarity_boost: 0.75 (slightly lower for more natural sound)
-- style: 0.15 (much lower for gentler, less dramatic delivery)
-- use_speaker_boost: true (maintains clarity)
